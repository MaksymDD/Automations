In this folder, I have attached two files: VBA_Dup.xlsm and macro_automate_gt.py. They can be used to test this project. Please note that in both files, you will need to set up paths.

For Python, please set up the path to the xlsm file.
In VBA, set up the path where CSV files with duplicated records are located, and specify the path where you would like to save your new CSV file.
