Hello, welcome to this automation project rooted in real-world work experiences—tasks routinely carried out by middle offices worldwide. 
These are the types of activities that can be easily automated, resulting in significant time savings.

An important note: you may find that this project is somewhat intricate, and certain aspects could be optimized for greater efficiency. 
However, as mentioned earlier, this project is a reflection of my work experience. I've intentionally added a touch of complexity to my tasks to make the process more enjoyable.

##Project description:
The purpose of this project is to automate the process which was created by me, but inspired by one of my tasks from past working experience:

•	We have a CSV file that contains columns A with account numbers, B - the location of accounts, and D number of shares held by the accounts. 
•	Some accounts are duplicated and our job is to capture these accounts and sum their total position.
•	After accounts are sorted out, we have to save this file in a new folder and send it to our colleagues from the team.
